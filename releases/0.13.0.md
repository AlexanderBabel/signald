# signald 0.13.0 (unreleased)

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.12.0...main)

This release begins the process of migrating account data to sqlite, and brings some new features to the client protocol.

Thanks to these contributors:
* @parazyd1 for some fixes to the debian packaging that were sent in via email
* @iomintz for fixing an issue with the debian control file ([!46](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/46))
* @nicocool84 for catching a [bug in the protocol documentation](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/commit/577f6d0f076466fe6006fea2e99c53519531830b)

## sqlite
A major portion of the data that signald stores on disk will now be in a sqlite database. This should bring speed
and resource improvements. When signald first starts, it will migrate all accounts, removing migrated data from the json
file after. Note that the json file is still in use, but will be fully eliminated eventually
([#89](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/89)). A
[`delete_account`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/delete_account.html) request type has been added as deleting a
single account now requires manipulating the database file (which contains all accounts) as well as simply deleting the
json file and account import/export is planned ([#142](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/142)).

## client protocol

Several v1 request types were added, mostly moving existing v0 functionality into v1 ([#88](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/88))

* [`delete_account`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/delete_account.html) - a new request type that deletes the
local account and optionally deletes the account from the server as well.
* [`generate_linking_uri`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/generate_linking_uri.html) - generate the URI needed to generate an account linking QR code
* [`finish_link`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/finish_link.html) - wait for a previously generated linking URI to be used
* [`list_groups`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/list_groups.html)
* [`list_contacts`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/list_contacts.html)
* [`create_group`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/create_group.html)
* [`leave_group`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/leave_group.html)
* [`add_device`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/add_device.html)
* [`register`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/register.html)
* [`verify`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/verify.html)
* [`get_identities`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/get_identities.html)
* [`trust`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/trust.html)
* [`typing`](https://docs.signald.org/actions/v1/typing.html)
